i0S 13 & Swift 5 -- Have you ever been asked what's your favorite movies/music albums of the year? Does it take you a while to figure out your answer? Well if so, Top Five is an app where you can save and track your favorite anything. Keep track of your favorite brunch places in your city, the greatest NBA players, or best shows of the year. So if someone asks you in 2025 what your top moments of 2020 were, you can quickly respond to them! If someone asks you what are the top things to do in Atlanta, you got them!
