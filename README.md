Well if so, Top Five is an app where you can save and track your favorite anything. Keep track of your favorite brunch places in your city, the greatest NBA players, or best shows of the year. So if someone asks you in 2025 what your top moments of 2020 were, you can quickly respond to them! If someone asks you what are the top things to do in Atlanta, you got them! 

# How it works
The app is very similar to a typical notes application. You have your overview screen with all your Top Five lists, and the detail screen has a prest list of 1. - 5. ready to fill out.
